# Library

JavaScript library project from The Odin Project

All functions are fully operational. Add a new book using the "new book" button, navigate the data with the "next/previous" buttons. Select a book with the navigation buttons and use "toggle read" to change its finished status, and "delete book" to remove entry.

Update 18 Oct 2021:
Project is integrated with Firebase. Authentication is provided through a Google account and required to save data. The save and load functions now operate exclusively with the Firebase backend to save data. Data is associated with the google account (based on the User Name) and persists across devices.
