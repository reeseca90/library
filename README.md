# Library

JavaScript library project from The Odin Project

NOTE: The 'Forms' lesson practice tells you to update this project with simple validation, but that validation has existed through the JavaScript since the functional commit.

All functions are fully operational. Add a new book using the "new book" button, navigate the data with the "next/previous" buttons. Select a book with the navigation buttons and use "toggle read" to change its finished status, and "delete book" to remove entry.

Uses localStorage to store the data. Press the "save local data" button to save, and press "load local data" to load. WARNING: "Load" button does not currently prompt the user, so you will overwrite any information you have with what is saved locally.

TODO:
Potentially change design. It is functional and has extra elements to it, but is not exceptional.
